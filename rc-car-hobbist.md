1. Wiring tips
	- Always use heat shrink tube on joints. 
	- Small plastic zip ties always helpful
	- Use as little colors as possible in wires so it looks cool :)

2. When two inconpatble parts need to come together.
	- The surface may be too slipery. Avoid use tapes at all time. 
	- Instead add heat shrink tube to smaller part and make it shrink on fire. 
	- The two surfaces should have enough resistance.
	- Use plastic zip ties to tighten the two things. Works really well.

3. How did I install the backlight?
	- (!) Never drill holes on the car body. It's always a bad idea.
	- Instead, use sand paper to sand off some of the paint, because the base plastic case is transparent. Simply add led to the interior of the case. When that light on, the color is going to tramit through the case and show good color.
